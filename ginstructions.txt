## GitHub Contribution Strategy

To maximize your GitHub contribution graph:

1. **Commit Frequently**: Make small, focused commits rather than large ones
2. **Commit Daily**: Make at least one commit every day
3. **Create Multiple Repos**: Split your project into multiple repositories (frontend, backend, documentation)
4. **Use Branches**: Create branches for features and merge them with pull requests
5. **Write Tests**: Add test files for your components and APIs
6. **Add Documentation**: Create markdown files explaining various aspects of your project
7. **Refactor Code**: Refactor and improve code quality as separate commits
8. **Fix Bugs**: Document bug fixes as separate commits

For each task prompt above, create multiple commits focusing on different aspects of the implementation. For example, when implementing the user authentication system:

1. Commit initial route setup
2. Commit user model creation
3. Commit password hashing implementation
4. Commit JWT token generation
5. Commit validation logic
6. Commit error handling
7. Commit tests for authentication
8. Commit documentation for the auth system

This approach will result in 8+ contributions to your GitHub graph from just one feature implementation.
